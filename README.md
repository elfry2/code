# kaku
The perfect code editor--not. It's a script to automate the installation of my minimal vim configuration.

## Installation
Execute ```git clone https://github.com/elfry2/kaku.git && cd kaku && ./main```.

## Usage
Execute ```vim```.

## Configuration
Plugins are managed using [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim), and registered in ```~/.vim/vundles```.
